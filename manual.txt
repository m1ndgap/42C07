The strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string s. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3).


ex01

Create a function ft_range which returns an array of ints. This int array should
contain all values between min and max.
• Min included - max excluded.
• Here is how it should be prototyped :
	int *ft_range(int min, int max);
• If the value of min is greater than or equal to max, a NULL pointer should be
returned.


ex02

Create a function ft_ultimate_range which allocates and assigns an array of ints.
This int array should contain all values between min and max.
• Min included - max excluded.
• Here is how it should be prototyped :
	int ft_ultimate_range(int **range, int min, int max);
• The size of range should be returned (or -1 on error).
• If the value of min is greater or equal to max’s value, range will point to NULL and
it should return 0.
